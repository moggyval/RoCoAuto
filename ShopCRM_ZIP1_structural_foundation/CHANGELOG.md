ZIP 1 – Structural Foundation
=============================

This release introduces the structural groundwork required for Tekmetric-style workflows.

Included:
- Jobs act as mandatory containers for line items
- Job-level totals (subtotal, cost, profit)
- Soft-delete (archive) for Repair Orders and Customers
- Archived ROs excluded from dashboard revenue and stats
- UI adjustments so line items are edited within jobs only

This ZIP is intentionally limited to structural changes.
Calendar, sharing, and dashboard polish come in ZIP 2 and ZIP 3.

See README.md for exact installation steps.
